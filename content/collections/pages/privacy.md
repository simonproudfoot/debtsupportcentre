If you cannot provide this information we may not be able to progress with your application or enquiry.</p>
                          <p>We may also use this information to contact you about and process your application, for example, sending you an email, text message or letter to welcome you to our services.</p>
                          <p>We will process the personal data we collect about you for the purposes set out below at purposes for processing your personal data.</p>
                          <p>After you have made you initial application/enquiry, if you also decide to go ahead with any of the products or services that we offer, the sections below explain how we will also process your data when we provide that particular product(s) or service(s).</p>
                          <h3 class="pt-2">Ongoing Services</h3>
                          <p>Where we are providing you with an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), or any other financial services solution, we will process your personal information to administer the services we provide. This may include contacting you where we may need further information, or sending you updates on the progress of the services we provide to you.</p>
                          <p>Where we provide ongoing services, we will normally require you to agree to the terms and conditions of the IVA or service. These will set out how we will provide the services to you and where we will be required, under the terms and conditions, to process your personal information. For example, we would need to your share information with your creditors to enable us to set up and administer an IVA.</p>
                          
                          <h2 class="pt-5" id="iva">Individual Voluntary Arrangement</h2>
                          <p>The information below specifically explains how and why your personal data will be used so that the services can be provided to you.</p>
                          <h3 class="pt-2">What personal data will we need to collect?</h3>
                          <p>To be able to provide our services we will need to collect certain categories of personal data. This will include:</p>
                          <ul>
                              <li>Contact Details: Your full name, address, contact number, e-mail address etc. We need this so that we can keep you updated on the progress of your IVA and contact you when necessary. We also need this information to draft your proposal to creditors.</li>

We need this so that we can decide whether an IVA is appropriate for you and so that we can draft and send a proposal to your creditors. Once you enter into an IVA, we need this information to ensure that we can collect payments and take any changes in circumstances into consideration when administering the IVA.</li>
                              <li>Income and Expenditure: Details of your financial position including all sources of income and your household expenditure. We need this so that we can draft your proposal to creditors and set the correct level of payments to be paid into your IVA.</li>
                              <li>Sensitive Personal Data: In some circumstances we may need to collect sensitive personal data however we will not do so without express consent from you and we will only do so where it is necessary for the purposes of assisting with your financial situation.</li>

                              <li>Call Recordings, Chat Logs and E-mails: When you contact us by telephone, your call may be recorded for training and monitoring purposes. We also keep any e-mail correspondence and online chat logs to help us to manage your IVA.</li>
                          </ul>
